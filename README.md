# Ussd-MenuServer
This is a server library for Ussd apps written in java. It auto creates menus for the app by taking menu items using the standard parent-child relationship of a tree structure.
Additionally, you provide selection handlers to respond to client selection. In here, you can place custom logic to serve what ever you want to server to your clients.
